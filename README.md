This web application acts as a personal AI-powered coach, providing real-time feedback to help users improve their public speaking, presentation, and communication skills. It actively listens, transcribes, and analyzes speech patterns to offer instant, constructive advice.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Transcription:** Utilizes the browser's Web Speech API to capture and display spoken words as they are said.
- **Live AI Analysis:** Securely streams the transcript to a backend server, which queries the Google Gemini API for in-depth analysis.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Delivers actionable advice on key public speaking metrics:
  - **Filler Word Detection:** Identifies and counts crutch words like "um," "ah," "like," and "so."
  - **Pacing and Flow:** Comments on the perceived speaking speed and rhythm.
  - **Clarity and Confidence:** Analyzes sentence structure and word choice to gauge effectiveness.
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface built with React and Bootstrap.
